Commentary for the required steps

2. when netserv. is running it shows this client is connected message, 
while netclient shows waiting state.
The server waits and listens to the socket for a client to make a connection request. If everything 
goes well, the server accepts the connection. Upon acceptance, the server gets a new socket bound to a different port.

The client in socket programming must know IP address of Server as it has to use that IP address in order to initialize the socket class constructor.
 That is how the client requests a connection to the server.

5. To create the server socket, the endPoint object can listen for incoming connections on any IP address but the port number must be specified. 
Once the socket is created, the server can accept incoming connections and communicate with clients. Hence, client is connected as on step 2

6. yes, we can do with peer 
to peer communication, does not
 need any central server or you can also use sockect or we can communicate with our ip address.

Hello Tsadiku. Thank you for your trail and go on doing. However, 

- where are the group members? they are not contributing at all

=>both are currently working the task on the local IDE becasue of this they have't contributing Status on the repositery.  i will correct it 

- your .cpp files are empty. Is there any challenge that I can help you with?

=>it takes time and require deep understanding we are try it. if we will face with  a problem i will ask you. konw we are try to write the code on the file and then if we have more understanding on it correct it therough process then it makes sense but the first code on the file may not be correct,  

- you are punished with the dead line passed. May you continue faster?

=>in the last weak  because of project proposal we are so busy if it is possible and we will
gate additional time we will try our best but still we try it and commit each day effort on the file
