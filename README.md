Hello Tsadiku. Thank you for your trail and go on doing. However, 

- where are the group members? they are not contributing at all
=>both are currently working the task on the local IDE becasue of this they have't contributing Status on the repositery.  i will correct it 

- your .cpp files are empty. Is there any challenge that I can help you with?
=>it takes time and require deep understanding we are try it. if we will face with  a problem i will ask you. konw we are try to write the code on the file and then if we have more understanding on it correct it therough process then it makes sense but the first code on the file may not be correct,  

- you are punished with the dead line passed. May you continue faster?
=>in the last weak  because of project proposal we are so busy if it is possible and we will
gate additional time we will try our best but still we try it and commit each day effort on the file
